## Bootstrapping

Bootstrapping is a resampling technique that involves repeatedly drawing samples from a data source with replacement, often to estimate a population parameter.
As such, Bootstrapping is commonly used when we have a small sample, thus wanting to be able apply our sample to a population (Law of Large numbers - with enough data, the empiracle distribution will be a good approximation of th true distribution)

As it is simply a resampling technique, this can be useful for several things
- Testing the accuracy of a model
- resampling
- generating sample data to represent population


Because bootstrapping is a sampling technique, our result generates distributionS of estimates (rather than one estimate)
Because we are generating several distributions, this will include the usage of confidence intervals.

NOT to be confused with cross-validation
