# Regularization
Helpful to avoid overfitting and reduce complexity of the model<br><br>

Note!! Whenever you use lasso or ridge regression, you MUST scale your data



### Lasso 
With lasso, the higher the alpha value, the less complex, The lower the alpha is, the more complex it is, andÂ the closer it is to regular linear regression

### Ridge
