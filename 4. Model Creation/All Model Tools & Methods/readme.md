### Model Overfitting
* Regularization (Lasso, Ridge, etc)

### Model Underfitting
*Cross Validation

## Regularization
!!!! DATA MUST BE SCALED FIRST
Used to avoid overcomplicating the data and overfitting. Made to make the model more general and applicable to unseen data or other datasets with the same features
__Lasso__

__Ridge Regression__

## Cross Validation
splits up the data to create several subgroups that helps generalize the data and hyperparameter tuning

## Pipelines

## GridSearchCV
combines cross validation, hyperparameter tuning, and scoring all in one function
