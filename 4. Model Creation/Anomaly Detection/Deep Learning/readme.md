# Anomaly Detection - Deep Learning
Deep learning techniques use neural networks for anomaly detection in large and complex datasets. <br>
Best for situations involving sequential/unstructured data or datasets with intricate patterns<br>

## Common Algorithms
* **Autoencoders:** Compress input data and reconstruct it. Anomalous data points have higher reconstruction errors
* **Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks:** Specialized for detecrting anomalies in time-series data by remembering long-term dependencis
