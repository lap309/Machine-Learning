All types of models can be used with anomaly detection but you need to understand the business use case because what qualities as an anomaly and the subsequent process of detection will vastly vary based on the goal and application. <br>
The nature of the data, the problem at hand, and the goals of the project are all things to consider before building a solution, making it hard to have a “universal” approach to anomaly detection.
