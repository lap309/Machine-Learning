# Clustering
Unsupervised technique where datapoints that are similar are grouped to each other to identify patterns in data

#### Applications of Clustering
- Looking for trends in data
- Data compression, all data clustering around a point can be reduced to just that point. For ex, reducing color depth of an image
- Pattern Recognition

### K-means Clustering
### Spectral Clustering
