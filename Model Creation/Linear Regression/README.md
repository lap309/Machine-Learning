# Linear Regression / Least Square Regression

y = mx + c

Creates a linear equation that minimizes the average distance from the line and each data point.

### Assumptions
1. Features are linearly independent of each other
2. Errors in the regression are notmally distributed (no bias)
3. Effects are linear functions of inputs
