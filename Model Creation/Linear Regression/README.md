# Linear Regression / Least Square Regression

y = mx + c

Creates a linear equation that minimizes the average distance from the line and each data point.

### Assumptions
1. Features are linearly independent of each other
2. Errors/Residuals in the regression are normally distributed (no bias)
3. There exists a linear relationship between x and y
