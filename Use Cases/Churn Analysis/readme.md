# Churn Prediction (Attrition)
In it's simplest form, churn/attrition is when customers leave. <br>
Predictive models are built to accurately predict churn and then companies take action by building targeted marketing campaigns around preventing ir or by making product changes to combat churn.
<br>


### Types of Churn
* Subscription Churn : when users/consumers are on contract for a set period of time (monthly subscriptions, work contract, etc.) and consuemrs decide not to come back after that period is over. This is easier to define, predict, and prevent since there's a clear defined window where churn is a risk and this period can be marketed on
* Non-subscription Churn: when users/consumers can end their relationship with the business at any time, they come and go at will. Signs of churn are harder to measure in this instance because indicators of churn are contextually dependent on the situation. For example, indicators of churn could be when user activity gradually declines or they could just stop their business all of a sudden. These are harder to define wince it is not pre-determined when a customer could start their churn period.

These are more contextual cases and will depend on the specific business organization and how they are measuring or defining churn.
* Mix of subscription and non-subscription churn

### Things to Consider
- How are we defining a "user"? For example, is someone who uses the product/service only once then enver again going to be considered churn? Or is there some minimal threshold after which a user should be considered and included in churn analysis?
- How are we defining churn? When do we consider a consumer lost?
- Do we have a defined churn period? How would we identify that in the data?
- What is this curn prediction going to be used for? Once we predict churn, what actions will we take next?
