So this will determine if the data that we're looking at actually makes sense, or if we need further cleaning, or if more data is actually needed. EDA will help us identify patterns and trends in the actual data set. <br> <br>

| Graph                  | Type of Data             | What to look for/When to use |
| -----------------------| ------------------------ | -----------------------|
| Bar Chart              | Categorical Data         | Count/Frequncy distribution of each category  |
| Comparative Bar Charts | Categorial Data          | Categorical data for groups |
| Stacked Bar Char       | Categorical Data         | Proportions of categories |
| Pie Chart              | Categorical data with a small number of possible categories | The proportions of each category in the dataset|
| Dot Plots              | Small numerical datasets | - A representative or typical value in the dataset  |
|                        |                          | - The extent to which the data values are spread out  |
|                        |                          | - The nature of the distribution of values along the number line   |
|                        |                          | - The presence of unusual values in the data set |
|                        |                          | - Locating groupings in the data, univariate, bivariate, multivariate data |
| Histogram              | Numerical Data (continuous and discrete) | - General distribution, shape and extent of spread or variability |
|                        |                          | - Center or typical value. Location and number of peaks |
|                        |                          | - Presence of gaps and outliers|
| Cumulative Relative Frequency |    | |
| Scatter Plot           | Bivariate Numerical Data  (x and y)| correlations or the relationship between two different columns |
|                        |                          | Shape, Relation, Trend |
| Box Plot               | Numerical Data           | Distribution, Outliers
