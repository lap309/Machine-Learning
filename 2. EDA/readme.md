| Graph                  | Type of Data             | What to look for/When to use |
| -----------------------| ------------------------ | -----------------------|
| Bar Chart              | Categorical Data         | Count/Frequncy distribution of each category  |
| Comparative Bar Charts | Categorial Data          | Categorical data for groups |
| Stacked Bar Char       | Categorical Data         | Proportions of categories |
| Pie Chart              | Categorical data with a small number of possible categories | The proportions of each category in the dataset|
| Dot Plots              | Small numerical datasets | - A representative or typical value in the dataset  |
|                        |                          | - The extent to which the data values are spread out  |
|                        |                          | - The nature of the distribution of values along the number line   |
|                        |                          | - The presence of unusual values in the data set |
|                        |                          | - Locating groupings in the data, univariate, bivariate, multivariate data |
| Histogram              | Numerical Data (continuous and discrete) | - General Shape and extent of spread or variability |
